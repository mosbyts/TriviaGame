# TriviaGame
The TriviaGame is a game used to check the users knowledge (or ability to correctly guess). The user will be given multiple questions to answer and at the end of the game will receive their total score.

This game was created as part of the University of Richmond Full Stack Flex Web Development program curriculum to further JavaScript skills. It is useful in practicing basic JS skills and furthering jQuery skills.

This game was created by making a simple HTML and CSS file then adding in a JavaScript file. Each changing number is a variable on the JS file with some being a span on the HTML file. Functions are included to make the code work, then conditional if/then statements are used to ensure the correct action happens (alert for wins and game refresh for losses). jQuery is used to shorten the JavaScript.

This version of the game was created by Tianna Mosby. For questions, concerns or additional help please contact me on GitHub at mosbyts.
