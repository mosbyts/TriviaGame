## Description
The TriviaGame is a game used to check the users Halloween knowledge (or ability to correctly guess). The user will be given multiple questions to answer and at the end of the game will receive their total score.

## Motivation
This game was created as part of the University of Richmond Full Stack Flex Web Development program curriculum to further JavaScript skills. It is useful in practicing basic JS skills and furthering jQuery skills.

## Tech Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- jQuery Library
This game was created by making a simple HTML and CSS file then adding in a JavaScript file. Each changing number is a variable on the JS file with some being a span on the HTML file. Functions are included to make the code work, then conditional if/then statements are used to ensure the correct action happens (alert for wins and game refresh for losses). The jQuery library is used to shorten the number of lines of code that would've been used by JavaScript.
